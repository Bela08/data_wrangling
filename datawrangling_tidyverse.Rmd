# Tibbles

>Tibbles are data.frames that are lazy and surly: **they do less** (i.e. they don't change variable names or types, and don't do partial matching) and **complain more** (e.g. when a variable does not exist). This forces you to confront problems earlier, typically leading to cleaner, more expressive code.

# `readr` package

# read_xxx function

* Neater import than `read.table` and `read.csv`

* Does data check and prints a report of the data imported

* Character columns are not converted to factors

* Most useful are `read_csv`, `read_table`, and `read_delim`

* Compatible with pipe workflow

# Example

```{r}
mydata<- read_csv("data/sub_PanTHERIA.csv")

#Lets practice!

create a long format of the subset data species, mass, height, and birth year with the species column, one column with the categories mass,height, birth year and one column with the values

# `nest` datasets

Useful when you want to run analyses group based but run it only ones

# Your turn!

Group the starwars dataset based on sex and nest it.
